// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

number = read input
if number % 2 == 0
    print "Even"
else
    print "Odd"

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are


declare numbers[] array

for each in numbers[]
    numbers[each] = read input

declare var average = 0
for each in numbers[]
    average += numbers[each]
average = average / 5

for each in numbers[]
    if numbers[each] < smallest
        smallest = numbers[each]
    if numbers[each] > largest 
        largest = numbers[each]

print "The average of the numbers is: " + average
print "The smallest number is: " + smallest
print "The largest number is: " + largest
